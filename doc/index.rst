.. topic:: Overview

      This package provides an API for modelling mixing crops involving several functional-structural plant models (FSPM). Its aim is to simplify the building of such simulations. 
      It takes place through the [MobiDiv](https://www6.inrae.fr/mobidiv/) research project, especially in the modelling of mixed crops with wheat and alfafa. 

      Currently, this API recognizes two FSPM, [CN-Wheat](https://github.com/openalea-incubator/WheatFspm) and [l-egume](https://github.com/glouarn/l-egume).
